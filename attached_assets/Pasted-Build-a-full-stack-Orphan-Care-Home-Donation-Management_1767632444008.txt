Build a full-stack Orphan Care Home Donation & Management App inspired by Aghosh Orphan Care Home under the Minhaj Welfare Foundation.

The app should provide a secure, user-friendly platform where individuals can learn about orphan care initiatives and donate for specific purposes such as healthcare, education, food, clothing, shelter, and general welfare.

🌍 App Purpose

The goal of this app is to support orphaned and vulnerable children by enabling transparent donations and sharing impact updates. The app should reflect humanitarian, ethical, and Islamic values, starting with a welcoming “Assalamu Alaikum” greeting.
